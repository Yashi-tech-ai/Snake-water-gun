🐍 Snake, Water, Gun – Python Beginner Project
This is my first basic project i made while learning python . Still a lot to learn and grow .

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Snake, Water, Gun game (a twist on Rock, Paper, Scissors).
I built this while learning conditionals, loops, and how to take user input in Python.

🎯 What I learned:
Taking input from the user
Generating random choices using the random module
Using if-elif-else statements for game logic
Basic terminal output
🔧 How to Run:
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

ps >> 💬 I'm still learning! Feedback or suggestions are always welcome. :)
